### StructuredAddress
Represents a structured address format used to provide detailed location information.
```typescript
interface StructuredAddress {
  streetName?: string;
  buildingNumber?: string;
  townName?: string;
  countrySubDivision?: string;
  postalCode?: string;
  country?: Alpha2CountryCode;
}
```

This interface provides a standardized way to represent address details, including:
- `streetName`: The name of the street
- `buildingNumber`: The building number on the street
- `townName`: The name of the town or city
- `countrySubDivision`: The subdivision of the country (e.g., state, province)
- `postalCode`: The postal or ZIP code
- `country`: The country, typically represented by a country code (Alpha2CountryCode)

All fields are optional, allowing for flexible address representation based on available information.
